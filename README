* to explain the title

  * the little cicada-nymph is for teaching purpose at first

  * it reuses the code and idea
    of the early version of cicada-language
    to teach my friends
    how to implement a interpreter
    of a simple programming language

  * I use assembly language (FASM for x86)
    to implement the interpreter

  * the programming language to be implemented
    is a threaded-code based (Forth-like) language

  * four versions of the interpreter are implemented
    |---------+-------|
    | linux   | 64bit |
    | windows | 64bit |
    | linux   | 32bit |
    | windows | 32bit |
    |---------+-------|



* to compile it

  1. download fasm (the flat assembler)
     from : http://flatassembler.net/
     or : https://github.com/the-little-language-designer/fasm

  2. choose your platform
     by editing "platform-configuration.inc"
     |-------------------------|
     | configuration           |
     |-------------------------|
     | define platform linux   |
     | define machine  64bit   |
     |-------------------------|
     | define platform windows |
     | define machine  64bit   |
     |-------------------------|
     | define platform linux   |
     | define machine  32bit   |
     |-------------------------|
     | define platform windows |
     | define machine  32bit   |
     |-------------------------|

  3. the command used to compile the source file
     
     fasm -m 100000 cicada-nymph.fasm
     
     1) "fasm -m 100000" means that
        fasm will use 100000 Kb of memory
        when compiling the source code

     2) you can also use the IDE of fasm (windows only)
        to compile the source file
        * for example
          File -> Open -> (choose the file)
          Options -> Compiler setup -> (set Memory to : 131072)
          Run -> Compile
          (output file will be saved in where the source file is)



* to play with it

  * just open it ^-^
    the interpreter will show you a welcome message

  * note that
    the "core.cn" must be in the same directory as the interpreter

  * when you are running the interpreter
    you can call a function by typing its name
    for example
    |-----------------+----------------------------------|
    | function name   | usage                            |
    |-----------------+----------------------------------|
    | test            | to do a little test              |
    | report-memory   | to get a report of memory usage  |
    | show-dictionary | to get a report of defined words |
    |-----------------+----------------------------------|
